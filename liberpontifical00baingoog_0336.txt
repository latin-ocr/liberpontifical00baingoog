Ia Oonoeoratioae Reqinae Motildae Litanio. 283

Praesulibus nostris subjectis oum sibi totis
Angligeniu turmis concedat dona salutis,
Qui super.
Noslro pontifici eujus sumus in diocesi
Det regnum vitae qui scandit et ipse superne.
Gloria victori.

The same Litany, in a slightly altered form, as far as the

break before Benedicat vos divina majestas, is found in the
Ely MS in Trinity College, Cambridge, immediately following
the Coronation Offioe but without personal names of Pope or
King, Queen or Arohbishop. The Saints invoked in that
MS are,

1. Olement, Syxtus, Peter-3

2. Edmund, Ermengeld, Oswald;

3. Mury, Felicitas, Perpetua3

4. Augustine, Dunstan, Elphege3

ὅ. Benediot;

6. Maurice, Sebastian, George3

The arrangement of the Litany‚ as to parts taken by
cantores and Chorus, as above given, is taken from this MS.
