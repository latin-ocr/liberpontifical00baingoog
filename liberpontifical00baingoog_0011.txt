nor does it contain the Fornrs for
4. The Conseerution of a Bishop.
5 The Coronation of a King and Queem
Offices in which the Arebbishop would officiata personally.

The volume in its present condition appears to be made up
of two MSS; the lst consisting of fon. 1-108. The second
of 109-fin. On the first leaf of the first ,half is written in a
later hand “prima quaterna'' and on fol. 108 “ultima
quaterna.''

It is said in a note on the last folio, that the volume consisto
of xiii. quaternium, which is the number from 108 ιο the end.
In the present volume these two halves have certainly been
misplaced. The Pontifical proper begins with fol. 114.; foll.
108-113 beinga prelia containing the form lor blessing the
greater boly water, as used in the consecration of Oburches duc.
