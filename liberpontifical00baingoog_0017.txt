The volume consists of three distinct parts.

First, the original Sacramentary, which Ihare referred ιο
, as Leofric A. This corresponds very closely with the
Gregorian Sacramentary edited by Muratori3 more particularly
with his (lodex Othobonianus.

Secondly, the Calendar aad Tables, which seem ιο be of a
later date than the Sacramentary. The Tables commence
A. D. 969. (Dr Rock and Mr Westwood.)

Thirdly, come additions to the old Sacramentary, not all in

one hand, of which far the larger portion at any rate were
written by direction of Bishop Leofric in A. D. 1050 or soon
after. This is referred to as Leot'ric Band described below
No. x.
· Some Saints' days in the calendar have led Dr Rock ιο
suppose that the MS may have been written, or at least used,
in Glsstonhury, or in some other monastery in the west of
England3 e. g.

Aug. 31 ; ln Glastonia, S. Aidani, Episcopi.

Sept. 25; ln Glastonia, S. Ceolfrithi, Abbatis. ’
There are among the cntries :-
Feb. 16; Ob. Brihtricus‚ Decanus.

Mar. 19; Hic obiit Lifingus‚ Episcopus.

Nov. 9; Obitus Eadulfi‚ Episcopi.

’ Lifing was Bishop of Devonshire (Crediton) A. D. 1031-
1046. Eadulf the first Bishop of Devonshire (Tawton) A. D.
909-911 and Dadulf II. Bishop of Devonshire (Crediton)
· A. D. 931; (Le N eve's Fasti; Hardy.)

The date of the original Sacramentary is not so clear.

In the saints invehed in the Litany, the latest are, as in
Egbert, S. Outhbert and S. Guthlac3 the last early in the
eighth century. S. Swithin, saec. ix, and S. Dunstan‚ saec. x,
are not named.

The handwriting of this part of the Volume is thought hy*
competent judges ιο be about A. 0. 930, not earlier. I am
inclined to think that it is copied from a MS dating very
early in the ninth century. There is nothing in fact in the
contents of the MS, which points ιο a later date than the
