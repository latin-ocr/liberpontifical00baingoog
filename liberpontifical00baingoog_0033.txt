Its contents are a great medley‚ and it is the work 11 ’
more thau 111 scribe. lt contains bomilies in Anglo·
’ Saxon3 sermons in Latin 11 1111111 matters; capitula
11 Oounoils, particularly fol. 201 “Capitula concilii apud
Wintoniam celebrati,” printed in wilkins, 1. 365, from this
MS, where 1111 put under the year 1076. Also, “ Poenitentis
institutio secundum decreta Normannorum praesulum ” at a
· Gouncil held under the presidency 11 Legate Ermenfred3
placed by Wilkins in 1076, 111 which probably should rather
be put in 1070. Now Herman was Bishop of Salisbury only
from 1075 to 1078. Osmund from 1078 11 1099. Considering
these dates and the ritual importance 11 111 MS. I aur fully
persuaded that 11 111 11 least as the Pontifical Offices go, it

- was written for and under the directiou 11 Bishop Osmund. .

The Offices in this MS belonging to the Pontifical‚ consist
11 three portione :—

1. Minor Benedictions which are to be found in almost all
the older Pontificals or sacramentaries.

2. Forma 111 Holy Thursday‚ Good Friday, Eastcr Eve‚
relic abesto, altar tabernacle, 111111 Consecratiou 1111111,
and for synoda, Ember days, and a lew minor matters.
These are verbally from the Ordo Romanus printed by
Hittorp.

3. Forms 111111 Benediction 11 Abbots‚ Nuus, Widows,
11111111110111111111111 Clergy3 these verbally correspoud
with the Forms 11 111 1211 century Pontificals, and probably
may be reasonably thought the work 11 Bishop Osmund
himself.
