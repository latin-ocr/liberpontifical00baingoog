Pontifieal 01 Ohiohele Arohbishop of Canterbury 1414-1443.
now in Trinity College Library‚ Cambridge.

In the form for Degrading an heretieal Olerlr‚ we have
fol. 214. “eopia vero hujusmodi sententia sequitur et talis
vel consimilis esse potest.”

“ In Dei nomine Amen. Nos Henricus permissione divina
Cantuariensis Archiepisoopus, totius Angliae Primus, dre.’' and
00 elsewhere in the same Offiee and in that for the henediction
of Grutohed Friars.

It 10 0 thick Volume‚ of 299f01. with musical notes, very
little ornament and not 0 handsome book.

lt contains Peokham's Βο001101100000 well as the ordinary
001, 001 some Offices peculiar 10 this MS„ as the Form for
profession of 00010101101000,0011101100 admission of Nuus
001 Priars of the order of S. Bridget.

These both lived in the same monastery, now Sion College,
founded in 1414. and the only English House 01 the order.

It 0100 has duplicate forms in one instance.

Consecratio Crucis (1) in forma ouriae Romanae.

There are very long Offiees for Enolosing Anchorites, both
male 001 female; and very full and various forms for
admissione into Monostie orders.

lt gives the Exoter Rubrio on Oolours, 00 well 00 the Sarum.

'l'he Use of Sarum is constantly referred to, and there are
repeated notices of the variatione between it and the Roman
Use.

ln the Appendix will be found the Confirmation Service 00
given in this MS, (which provides for two points not elsewhere
notieed, confirmation on 0 journey and hypothetioal Con-
firmatiom) and the office t'or laying the Fouudution Stone of 0
Ohuroh.

The statement in the old catalogus Generalis that this
was 0 Pontifioal 01 the time of Philip and Mary‚ appears to
have been founded on nothing better than the title of the

mas “Pro Rege et Regina.”
