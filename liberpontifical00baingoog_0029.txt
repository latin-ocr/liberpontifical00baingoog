The Office for blessing Pelms 1 cannot find elsewhere. It
moy be eu insertion of Leofric, though in the midst of
extracts from the Ordines Romani. It is immediately pre-
ceded hy the words, “Subbato ente Pelmes Domnus Papo

Hittorp, ⁴* on which see the account which follows of Vitell.

' Cotton MSS. Vitellius E. xii. British Museum.

This MS is one of the volumes of the (lotton Librury thet
suffered from the fire in 1731. It is now only a· collectiones
fragments which are in great disorder.

Part· of the volume, from 116-160, consiste of fragments,
the remeius of en Ordo Romanus, to which ere appended the
Benedictions of the images of S. Peter end S. Swithin, some
prayers, addresses in the Offices for the Sielr, end s Litany.

This Ordo Romanus is identicel with one printed by
Hittorp iu his “de Divinis catholice Ecclesiae Officiis.”

⁴* An amount of this Ordo printed by Hittorp will he found in the
Tubingen Theologicsl Quarterly for 1862 in an article by Dr Mechel
pp. 51-53.

It hus been, conjectured by some, but on very questionohle grounds, thet
the Ordo in its present stete came from the hands of Beruoldus os constance,
Dr Rock thinks thet perhaps it use adopted to the Oologne use. Iam
indebted for this note es well es for much else, to hir Ε. Bishop of Ilsher,
who edds his opinion thet the MS described by Morinus de Ordinutthnibus,
p. 257 of the let pagination, isan ecrlier sud s simplet form of the eume
Ordo.
