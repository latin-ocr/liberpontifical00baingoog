There is also bound up in this volume, the Coronation

anglorum, Saxonum. Anglo-Saxonum, and the like, are
omitted. This is the Goronation Offiee found in the xiitb
century Pontificals.

VIII.

< Pontifical of S. Thomas a Becket.

Now in the Public Library, Douai3 MS 94.

This MS is well known, from being described in the Voyage
LItteraire of Martene and Durant. lt was originally at
Marchiennes and is traditionally the Pontifical of Arehbishop
Becket. The handwriting of the MS is said to be of the l2th
century, but it is certainly copied from one earlier than the

Conquest. It almost throughout verbally agrees with
Arehbishop Robert's book and Claud. A. III (Ethelred’s

Coronation Offiee) and with O. 0. Ο. 146, and it has none of
the modificati0ns found in all the l2th century MSS.

In the Consecratio Regis, it has :-

“ hune famulum tuum ill. quem supplici devotione in regem
Anglorum vel Saxonum pariter eligimus ; ‘’

and:-

“ Hie totius regni Anglorum Saxonum eeclesiam deinceps
eum plebibus sibi annexis ita enutriat.'’

The whole Coronation form is identieal with those earlier
than the accession of Henry Ι. lt will be found in the
Appende to this Volume p. 267.
