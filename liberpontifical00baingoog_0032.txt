Pontificals of English andacoah Usc. xxvii Ι

in the appendix to this volume. It has musical notes. The
names of King William, Queen Matilda, Pope Alexander and
Archbishop Aldred will be found in the Litany. The Litany
therefore, must have been written between the years 1067-
1070 when Alexander was Pope and Aldrcd was the only
Archbishop acknowledged by the King, and who therefore,
is prayed for as the Archbishop of the realm and not merely
as Archbishop of a province.

Having regard to the character of this Litany, and tho
circumstance that it is found in a generalized and slightly
modified form in the Ely Pontifical in the library of Trinity
Collega described below, in immediate connection with the
Coronatiou Office, and lastly, to the prominence given in it to
Matilda‚I am led to think that it is the Litany sung at the
coronatiou of Matilda by Archbishop Aldred in 1068.

At the conclusion of the Form for consecrating a bell, is
the rubrio, not found in Hittorp :—

“Tunc sub trina infusione aquae sanctae, impone ei nomen,
si velis.’'

With this may be compared the concluding rubrio of the
Office iu the Sarum Manual 2-

“Deinde aspergatur aqua benedicta, et totus populus
presens. Et imponatur sibi nomen per sacerdotem, apponendo
manum supra et simul imponunt patrini et matrina. Et post
presbyterum nominant suum (i. e. campanae) nomen co-
operiendo cloccam lintheo.”

In the Form for admission of a monk, the Profession runs
