lt will be seen that two of the Offices in Leofric B and
a considerable portion of Tiberius O l to be next described,
are copied from this Ordo printed by Hittorp, which therefore
is of great importance‚ if it is indeed the original document
to which were due the changes in the Pontifical Services
which are found between the 12th century books and
those 'hitherto described with the exception of Leofrio Β.
There is a very marked change in ceremonial, in the
wording of rubrica and in the prayers, between the first
nine MSS above described, and those which follow. In this
volume, in Leofric B, and partly in Tiberius O 1, we have the
Offioes found in this Ordo with scarcely a verbal change.
Aftcrwards‚ partly in Tiberius O'l and wholly in the l2th
century and later Pontificals, the Offioes are formed by
combination of those in the older Angla-saxon Pontificals,
and those in this Ordo.. ,

Iam inclined tc believe that these Forma were introduced
into England by Lcofric: and that the second change, that to
Forma based partly on this Ordo and partly on the older
Rituals, was due to Bishop Osmund. There is an extreme
similarity between all the l2th century books, which certainly
points to some one original.

This Ordo Romanus is supposed by Hittorp to have been
sent into Franco by Popc Stephcn in the reign of Pcpin or
Chnrleniagnc.

Tho apponded Forma of Consecration of Images of S. Peter
and S. Swithin, which appear to have originally formed part
of the samo volume though written possibly by another
scribe, show this volume to have hoen a Winchestcr book,

that Cathcdral having been dedicated originally to S} Mnry
and S, Peter. afterwards also to S. Swithin.
The Litany with which the MS. concludes, will bc found
