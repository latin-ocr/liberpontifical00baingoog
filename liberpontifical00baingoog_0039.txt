This volume, which is magnificently written, though
without ornamented capitale or illuminatione, was originally
written for soma Suffragan of the Province of Canterbury.
This appears from the Decretum de Electo Episcopo, and the
Examinatio Episcopi, wherein it agrees with the Magd. coll.
MS. above described (no. xviii.) It became afterwards the
property ol a Bishop of Glasgow, as is shown, just as in the
case of the Exeter book, by the Abbot's profession, the name
ol the original Diocese having been erased and that of
Glasgow inserted in a hand of the same period.

“Vis sanctae Ecclesiae Glasguensi canonicam per omnia
subjectionem exhibere.”

'vhe only variatione from the Hereford and Dublin Books,
of any note are in the Forma for Consecration of Nuus.

In the middle of this volume is bound up the Coronation
tlltice for Charles V. of France, on which see the note in
hlaskell Manum. Rit. iii.. p. 14. Ι will only add that the

n Nordanenimlnorum sceptra non deserat,” does not occur in
⁴any known English Pontifieal.

churohcs consecrated or reconciled by the Scottish primate.
It isa small quarto, well and correctly written, and with
musical notation.
