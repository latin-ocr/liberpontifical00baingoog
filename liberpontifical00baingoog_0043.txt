The order for Consecration of Nuns printed by Mr Msskell
Mon. Rit. vol. 2. 307. is a translation 01 the form in this
book. That English Version was given to the 000νο01 01
Νο00 01 S. Msry, Winchester, by Bishop Fax, who held the
See from A. D. 1500, to 1528.

British Musrum3 Lansdowne MSS. 451. Saee. xiv.

This is a very tine folio MS, perfect, with illuminatione
and some carious pictores.

lt has been called from entries‚ the Evesham, and therefore
an Abbatial Pontifical‚ and from the rubrio 00 Oolours fol. '

18. 19. where Ecclesia nostra Exon. is named, ithus been
assigned to Exeter.

It may have belonged t0 Evesham after the death of its

owner, buti is in no sense an Abbatial Pontifieal. And the ·

expression in the rubria on Oolours proves nothing. This
1100 been taken from some Exeter book and inserted without
alteration. lt is found also in Archhishop Ohiehele's ,
Ρο01111001, (Νο xxviii. infra) and 0000 79, (Νο xxvii.)
totidem verbis.

The MS. was written for a Bishop 01 100000, 000 would
refer only 1ο the Use of S. Paul’s, οο far 00 11 referred to any
special Use at all.

The Widows’ profession fol. 75 is “Ego N. vidua, non
conjugata, promitto et voveo Deo et beatae Mariae 01 sanetis
omnibus in praesentia vestra, Reverende in Christo pater
Domine N. Londinensis Episcope, propositum castitatis
vidualis perpetuae juxta regulam beati Pauli apostoli. In
nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.'’

The volume 0100 agrees throughout very closely with

0000. 79, the Pontifical 01 clifford Bishop of London.
