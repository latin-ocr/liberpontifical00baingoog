ι Appendix to the 2nd volume of the York Missal‚ Sortees

Society‚ vol. lx. and the Manual Offices, in the Appendix to
the reprint of the York Manual, vol. lx. in the same series.

Iwill only repeat the conviction which Ι have elsewhere
expressed, that this Pontifical was compiled or rather copied
from one compiled without any reference to the “Use of
Bangor.”

Pontifical of De Martivall‚ Biahop of Salisbury 1315-
1329 (Godwyn).
⁸ Now in the Bodleian Library; Bawlinaon MSS. 0. 400.

In consideration of its importance as the sole relic of any
, Pontifical belonging to a Bishop of Salisbury since the time
‘of Bishop.0smund, this MS, which is but a small fragment,

ia printed at length in the Appendix to thia volume.

British Museum3 Harleian MSS. 561. Saec. xiv.

'I'his is also a fragment. It contains :-

1. Alterations to be made in the Office of the Mass, when Α
a Biahop was celebrant.

2. Benedictio Virginunr.

3. Benedictio Sanctimonlalis non Virginis post vel infra
annum probationis.

4. Benedictio Regia et Reginae. .

5. De Ordinibus conferendis, breaking off in the Ordination
dDmmm.

The Coronation Office is something between the Liber
Regalis and the form printed from Mm. iii. 21. Cambridge
Univ. Library by Mr Maslrell.

The Pontifical is assigned to Winchester from tho Form
of Benediction of Nuus.
