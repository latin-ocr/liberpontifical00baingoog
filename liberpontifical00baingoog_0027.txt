xxii Pontifieale os English ond Sootcb Uee.

“Credis sanctam catholicam et Apostolicam unam esse
veram Ecclesiam Μ’

we have in the margin :-

“Artieulus hic de Transubstantiatione et articulus ds
corporali prasentia sanguinis in novo Pontifioali Anglico
inseruntur; et in Pontificali Romano hi articuli praedicti non
habentur.”

The MS appears to have been written for an Archbishop
of Canterbury, and probably in the reign of Edward the
confessor.

The profession of the Bishop is, to be ‘⁶ obediens sancte
Dorobernensi eeclesioe.”

itis a very bandsome volume, with little ornament but
very well written in one hand throughout.

The English saints named in the Litanies are, AElphege,
Dunstan, Swithin, Outhbert, Gutblac, AEtheldrytha‚ Mildrytha,
Edward.

The expressions in the ‘⁴ Consecrotio Regis ’¹ arc :-

“ in regem Anglorum vel Saxonum ;”
¹ “ totius regni Anglo·Saxonum ; '’

‘⁴ Anglorum vel Saxonum.”

The words “Anglicus” and “Anglo-Saxonicus,’‘ occur
perpetually in the Antiphone and Prayers in this Offiee.

Its chief characteristics are, the great lengthening of all
the Offices by the addition of long new prayers and by insertione
in the old prayers3 by the introduction of very frequent
references to the intercession of Saints, far beyond any other
Pontifical.

The only Office in which this MS clearly follows earlier
MSS is that for Ordeals with which it concludes.

Several of the shorter Forms do not occur in any other
English Pontifical‚ as that “ ad ordinandum Deeauum,‘’ which
consiste of two prayers nearly identieal with those given
in Martene (de Rit. 2. l Ordo vi.) as a form for the Benediction
of an Abbot‚ from a Rheims manuscript.

Nasmyth‘s Oetalogus says of this MS :-

“ Codex membranaceus, forma quadrato, in folio, ante

conquisitionem Angliee, ut videtur, scriptus.’‘
